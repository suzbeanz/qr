# QR Code Safety Awareness Campaign ðŸš¨

## Overview
This project is a public service announcement (PSA) designed to educate people about the dangers of scanning unknown QR codes. The campaign uses an interactive webpage that people discover by scanning QR codes placed in public spaces.

## The Strategy
By placing QR code stickers around communities and public spaces, I'm creating a hands-on learning experience that demonstrates the very risk we're warning about. When people scan these codes, they're taken to a safety education page instead of something malicious - turning a potentially dangerous habit into a learning opportunity.

## Community Involvement
If you would like to help spread the word, please feel free to respectfully distribute QR codes to this
